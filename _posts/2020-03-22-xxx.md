How I used the Python AST capabilities to build the [Python to Rpn converter](https://pyrpn.atug.com/) .

My program works at the AST stage of the compilation pipeline:

The converter does rely on the Python compiler. Specifically my approach has been to use Python's built in ability to parse itself into an AST [Abstract Syntax Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree), then to traverse this tree using the visitor design pattern to generate the RPN.  
  
For example, the following Python code:

```python
import ast  
import astunparse  
print(astunparse.dump(ast.parse('x = 1 + 2')))
```

will generate the following AST data structure representing `x = 1 + 2`:

```
Module(body=[Assign(  
    targets=[Name(  
    id='x',  
    ctx=Store())],  
    value=BinOp(  
    left=Num(n=1),  
    op=Add(),  
    right=Num(n=2)))])
```
  
If you are interested, here are [the slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1_qNKLofUwPhs_LsF-AQM-0WstS2jeYrusU5El4RLfnc/edit?usp=sharing) of a recent talk I gave to a local Python User Group in Melbourne, Australia, about how I used the Python AST capabilities to build the Python to Rpn converter. The reception to the talk was good, but became fun and buoyant once the audience realised I had targeted an old HP calculator with this fancy Python technology - especially when I pulled out my HP calcs for all to see and touch.
